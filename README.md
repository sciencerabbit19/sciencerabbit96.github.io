## 🧭 About this repository

This repository hosts my personal portfolio.  
It showcases a selection of projects, analyses, and tools I have developed over the years, mostly focusing on:

- statistical modelling  
- causal inference  
- machine learning  
- longitudinal biological datasets  
- microbiome, hormonal, and lipidomic data  

My goal is to build clear and reproducible workflows that uncover structure and meaningful relationships within complex datasets, rather than focusing merely on correlations.

## 📂 Selected Projects

### **1. Free data analysis projects
In this repository you'll find folders with the name of the project, basically with some file .md cointaing data analysis I perfomed on that public data just for fun. Enjoy it!

### **2. Women4Health – Hormones & Vaginal Microbiome**
Longitudinal analysis pipeline for exploring relationships between hormonal profiles, lipids, and vaginal microbiome composition.  
Includes mixed-effects modelling, robust statistical tests, and exploratory visualisation tools.

### **3. Astrolabe**
Experimental R framework for identifying candidate causal directions in high-dimensional datasets.  
Combines entropy-based scoring, bootstrap and permutation robustness, and random forest importance measures.

## 🧑‍💻 About me

I hold a Master's degree in Mathematics, where I focused on differential geometry, category theory, and topology.  
I later moved into machine learning and data science, and I currently work as a Research Fellow at the National Research Council (CNR), where I analyse a wide range of biological datasets and develop statistical and ML pipelines for multi-omics research.
