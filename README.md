## 🧭 About this repository

This repository hosts my personal portfolio.  
It collects a selection of projects, analyses, and tools I have developed over the years, mainly in the context of:

- statistical modelling  
- causal inference  
- machine learning  
- longitudinal biological datasets  
- microbiome, hormonal, and lipidomic data  

My goal is to build clear, reproducible analyses that uncover structure in data rather than focusing solely on correlations.
