## 🧭 About this repository

This repository hosts my personal portfolio.  
It showcases a selection of projects, analyses, mostly focusing on:

- statistical modelling  
- causal inference  
- machine learning  
- longitudinal biological datasets  
- microbiome, hormonal, and lipidomic data

## 📂 Selected Projects

### **1. Free data analysis projects
In this repository you'll find folders with the name of the project, basically with some file .md cointaing data analysis I perfomed on that public data just for fun. Enjoy it!

### **2. Women4Health – Hormones & Vaginal Microbiome
Longitudinal analysis pipeline for exploring relationships between hormonal profiles, lipids, and vaginal microbiome composition.
Includes mixed-effects modelling, robust statistical tests, and exploratory visualisation tools.
Below you will find the link to the repository where the scripts related to my first paper are collected, of which I am one of the first authors.

### **3. Astrolabe**
Experimental R framework for identifying candidate causal directions in high-dimensional datasets, designed by me and a colleague (https://github.com/fgrosso98).
It combines entropy-based scoring, bootstrap and permutation robustness, and random forest–based importance measures. The framework is still pending publication, but it will be released very soon.

## 🧑‍💻 About me

I hold a Master's degree in Mathematics, where I focused on differential geometry, category theory, and topology.  
I later moved into machine learning and data science, and I currently work as a Research Fellow at the National Research Council (CNR), where I analyse a wide range of biological datasets and develop statistical and ML pipelines for multi-omics research.
